## Learn Data Science step by step through real Analytics examples, Data Mining, Modeling, Tableau Visualization and more!

This is the course where you can kick-start your journey towards the data science field.

This course is basically divided by 4 part.

Part 1: Data visualization

Part 2: Modelling

Part 3: Data Preparation

Part 4: Communication & Presentation

### Tools used in this course:
Tableau,Gretl,SQL,SSIS

### About:

In Part 1, you will know how to visualize the data by using Tableau. You will also learn some basic statistical concepts like chi-squared test.

In part 2, you will know about types of regression, how to build a model and how to analyze the model by using a statistical package like Gretl. The main disadvantage of this course is, you will not learn modelling by using Python or R programming.
To learn modelling by using Python or R, you have to check the course by same instructor Kirill Eremenko which I am providing link here. Link: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/">Machine Learning for data science</a>

In part 3, you will know how to prepare data by using ETL(Extract-Transform-load) concept. So for ETL process we use Microsoft visual studio(MSVS) shell for performing SQL Server Integration Services(SSIS). After performing ETL process, we store the data in a relational database system by using SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS).

In part 4, Instructor tried to convince us that communication and presentation skill is also most important skill to become a data scientist which we all ignored a lot.
