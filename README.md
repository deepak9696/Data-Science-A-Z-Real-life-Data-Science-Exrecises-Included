___
## Learn Data Science step by step through real Analytics examples. Data Mining, Modeling, Tableau Visualization and more!
___
Extremely Hands-On... Incredibly Practical... Unbelievably Real!

This is not one of those fluffy classes where everything works out just the way it should and your training is smooth sailing. This course throws you into the deep end.

In this course you WILL experience firsthand all of the PAIN a Data Scientist goes through on a daily basis. Corrupt data, anomalies, irregularities - you name it!
# This course will give you a full overview of the Data Science journey. Upon completing this course you will know:
___
How to clean and prepare your data for analysis

How to perform basic visualisation of your data

How to model your data

How to curve-fit your data

And finally, how to present your findings and wow the audience

This course will give you so much practical exercises that real world will seem like a piece of cake when you graduate this class. This course has homework exercises that are so thought provoking and challenging that you will want to cry... But you won't give up! You will crush it. In this course you will develop a good understanding of the following tools:

SQL

SSIS

Tableau

Gretl
